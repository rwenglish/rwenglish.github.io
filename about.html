<body>I am a passionate developer with a love for anything tech, I have spent time as an 
    educator at an ICode Franchise location while attending college molding a new generation
    of developers. Additionally I have done freelance tutors. I have a year of experience in
    the tech field and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology 
    after completing my Associate's in the same field. You can consult my portfolio to view
